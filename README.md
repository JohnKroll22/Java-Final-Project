This is code for the game BlackJack. This game is played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards (no Jokers are used).

Rules:
1. The goal of the game is to get 21 points. Going over 21 is an automatic loss and is called a Bust. If both players are under 21, whoever has the higher hand wins.
2. Cards 2-10 are all worth the value of their card (2-10). Jack, Queen, and King are all worth 10 points. An Ace can be either 1 or 11 points based on what the player decides.
3. To start the game, the dealer and the user both receive 2 cards, one face up and the other face down. Each player can look at their own face down card. Their current total is the value of their two cards summed.
4. The user goes first. They have two options, Hit or Stay. If they choose Hit, they will get the next card in the deck which is then placed face up in front of them. The card's value is added to their total. They keep going until they Bust or choose to Stay. If they choose Stay, they don't receive any more cards and their total is locked. It is now the dealer's turn.
5. The dealer has the same two options, Hit or Stay. However, they must Hit until they have a minimum of 17 points.
